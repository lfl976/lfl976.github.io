<p>Hello, I'm Wilde! ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>
	Iâ€™m a full-stack engineer with a passion for frontend development and sharing knowledge. 
	With over 6 years of experience, Iâ€™ve worked on diverse projects, including AI products, 
	job platforms, and large-scale system designs.
</p>

<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<p>
	Outside of coding, I enjoy learning Japanese and exploring the intersection of technology and daily life. 
	I started this blog to share my journey in programming, language learning, and personal growth.
</p>

<h2>What I Do</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Frontend Development</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue</li>
	<li><strong>Backend Development</strong>: Java, Spring</li>
	<li><strong>Databases</strong>: MySQL, PostgreSQL</li>
	<li><strong>Languages</strong>: Fluent in Chinese, Intermediate in English and Japanese</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Journey</h2>
<p>
	From building small apps to contributing to large-scale systems, my career has been a continuous learning experience. 
	Working in Japan has also strengthened my language skills and broadened my cultural understanding.
</p>

<h2>Whatâ€™s Next?</h2>
<p>
	Iâ€™m looking to dive deeper into AI and machine learning while continuing to share knowledge with the community. 
	I also aim to improve my Japanese to achieve fluent communication.
